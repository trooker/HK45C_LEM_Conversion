Copied my comments to HKPart Customer Survey of HK 45ACP LEM Conversion Kit
HK PARTS 
5 Stars

Purchased the 45C LEM conversion kit. It arrived quickly with all the parts in excellent shape.

This is a project that requires patience and a bit of mechanical skill. The documentation and youtube videos are not really that helpful. But it is all you have.
Search using"hk 45C LEM Conversion Instructions" to locate the four youtube videos by uber3D and the USP LEM conversions to which he refers. HKParts does not allow the inclusion of the URLs in this review. If I have time over the next couple of weeks I will put the information in GITHUB (search github trooker) to locate Lucca Uzzo's collection of repositories/projects.

Try the grease trick on the hammer assembly-cocking sprig group. That was helpful.

The hint about using a small tooth brush handle to push the gunlock (#28) during gun strut-gun spring compression works well.

Either spend the time to create suitable holding fixtures or have someone one to standby as an apprentice while you stress-hold and the apprentice plugs the pins.
